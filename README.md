# DSA in Golang

Welcome to the **DSA in Golang** repository! This is a personal project where I document my daily progress in solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using the Go programming language. Each day, I tackle new questions, learn from them, and note key takeaways to reinforce my understanding and growth.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
dsa-Golang-/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ question1.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ question2.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day-2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ question1.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helper_functions.go  # Common utility functions
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

- **`day-{n}/`**: Contains the solutions for all questions solved on a particular day, with individual files for each question and a `README.md` summarizing learnings.
- **`utils/`**: Common helper functions used across solutions.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project and its purpose.

## Daily Progress

Every day:
1. **Solve Problems**: Choose a set of DSA problems from various sources (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks).
2. **Document Learnings**: Record the concepts and techniques learned from each problem in a `README.md` file inside the corresponding day folder.
3. **Refactor Code**: Improve the efficiency and readability of solutions where applicable.
4. **Utilities**: If a helper function is generic, it is moved to the `utils/` folder.

---

## Goals

1. Strengthen problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms.
2. Deepen my understanding of Go and its idiomatic practices.
3. Create a portfolio of solved DSA problems for reference and future interviews.

## Example Notes for a Day

**Day 1**  
- **Question 1**: Solved a problem related to array rotations. Learned about the **modulo operation** for handling array indices in circular problems.  
- **Question 2**: Solved a linked list reversal problem. Refreshed concepts on **pointer manipulation** in Go.

**Day 2**  
- **Question 1**: Explored binary search trees. Understood how to write a recursive function for tree traversal efficiently in Go.

## How to Run Solutions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UseStateShivam/dsa-in-golang.git
   cd dsa-Golang-
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's folder:
   ```bash
   cd day-1
   ```

3. Run a specific solution:
   ```bash
   go run day-{n}/questionName.go
   ```
